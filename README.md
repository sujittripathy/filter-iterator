# filter-iterator
Filter Iterator project which will iterate the list of objects and filtered out based on a filter rule.

This project uses JUnit as an unit testing tool and tested for Integer and String test. 
  - All integers are getting filtered out if the value is less than 0.
  - All Strings are getting filtered out if the string is empty.
